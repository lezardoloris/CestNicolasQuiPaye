# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created

# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
